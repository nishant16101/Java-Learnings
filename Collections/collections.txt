Concrete collections in Java are actual implemenations of collections interfaces such as List,Set,Queue and Map.These are part of the Java collection Frameworks

They provide ready-to-use data structures like:

ArrayList, LinkedList → implements List

HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet → implements Set

HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap → implements Map

PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque → implements Queue
