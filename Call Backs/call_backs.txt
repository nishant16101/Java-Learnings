A callback is a technique where a method passes another method as an argument and later calls it when needed
The calling methods does not need to know the exact implementation of the callback method - it just invoke when require

Types of callback in java
1.Synchronous Callbacks - The callback function is executed immediately
2.Asynchronous Callbacks-The callback function is executed later


Why Use Callbacks
1.Decouples execution logic from result handling
2.Improves Flexibility-You can pass different callback implementation
3.Used in event driven programming
4.Essential for multi threading and Asynchronous operations
