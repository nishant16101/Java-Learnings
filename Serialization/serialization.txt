Serialization is the process of converting Java Object into byte stream, so it can be:
 1.Saved to a file 
 2.Sent over a network
 3.Store in database
DeSerialization is the reverse process - converting a byte stream back into object


Why use Serialization?
Save the state of an object permanently.

Transfer objects between JVMs or across networks.

Enable deep cloning (as a trick).

Required for many Java EE features (like HTTP sessions).
