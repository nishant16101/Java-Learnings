An Abstract class in java is class that cannot be instantiated and is mean to be extended by other classes .It may contain abstract methods
and concrete methods(with implementation)

Key Features
-Cannot be instantiated(Objects cannot be directly created)
-Can have both abstract and concrete methods
-Forces subclasses to implement abstract methods
-Can have constructors,static methods and final methods.
-Can have instance variables and implemented methods


 Interview Questions on Abstract Classes
Why do we need abstract classes in Java?
→ To enforce a common structure while allowing different implementations in subclasses.

Can an abstract class have constructors?
→ Yes, constructors are used to initialize fields of an abstract class.

Can an abstract class have static methods?
→ Yes, static methods belong to the class and can be used without creating an object.

Can we create an object of an abstract class?
→ No, but we can create an object of a subclass that extends the abstract class.

Can an abstract class implement an interface?
→ Yes, an abstract class can implement an interface and provide partial implementations.
