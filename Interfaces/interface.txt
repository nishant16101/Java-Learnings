An interface in java is a blueprint of class that defines a set of abstract methods(without implementation) and constants.It is used for acheiving full abstraction and multiple inheritance

Key Features of Interfaces
Defines abstract methods (until Java 7).
 Can contain default & static methods (Java 8+).
 Supports multiple inheritance in Java.
 All variables are public, static, and final by default.
 All methods are public and abstract by default (except default & static methods in Java 8+).
 Cannot have constructors (because they cannot be instantiated).

Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This allows a class to combine behaviors from multiple sources, which can be useful in certain scenarios. However, it also introduces complications, like the "Diamond Problem."

The Diamond Problem occurs when two parent classes have a method with the same name, and the child class inherits from both. The ambiguity arises in determining which method the child class should inherit, leading to potential conflicts.

Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes primarily to avoid this complexity. Instead, Java uses an alternative approach: interfaces. Interfaces allow a class to implement multiple sets of behaviors without inheriting the implementation details, thus eliminating the Diamond Problem while still enabling flexibility.
