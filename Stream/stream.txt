A Stream is a sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations.Think it of like as a pipeline where you send a collection of data through various operations like filter,map,sort and reduce
Key Features
 1.Not a data structure - it does not store elements
 2.Lazy evaluation -operations are executed only when needed
 3.Can be infinite - eg.Stream.iterate()
 4.Supports method chaining
