Generics allows you to write type safe reusable code in Java
Instead of writing the same code for multiple data types, write a single class method interface that works with any object type

Generic Class: Define a class with a placeholder for type.

Generic Method: Define a method that works with any type.

Bounded Types: Restrict generic types to a subclass or interface.

Wildcards: Unknown generic types (?, ? extends, ? super).
