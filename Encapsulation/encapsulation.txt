Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data variables and code into single unit while restricting direct access to some details
It is fundamental OOP Principal that ensures data security and hides implementation details

How to achiece Encapsulation?
->Make instance variables private
Provide public getter and setter methods to access and update private variables
Ensure controlled access to data

Advantages of Encapsulation
 Data Hiding: Prevents direct modification of variables.
 Better Security: Controlled access using getters and setters.
 Improved Maintainability: Easy to update class logic without affecting other parts of the program.
 Increased Flexibility: Can modify validation logic without changing external code.
