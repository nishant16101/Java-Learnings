Polymorphism:
   Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).It allows methods or functions to behave differently based on the object that invokes them
   Polymorphism is classified into two types:
     1. Compile time Polymorphism (Static binding) - Achieved through method overloading
     2. Run time Polymorphism (Dynamic binding) - Achieved through method overriding 

Dynamic Method Dispatch:
  Dynamic Method Dispatch also known as Runtime Polymorphism is a mechanism in java where methods calls are resolved at runtime not Compile time
  key  points-
    - It is Achieved through method overriding
    - the method that gets executed is determined by the actual object not the reference
    - method resolution happens at runtime which enhances flexibility and extensibilty in oop 
    - Use superclass reference to point to subclass objects

How does Dynamic Dispatch Work?
A superclass reference is used to refer to a subclass object.

When a method is called using this reference, Java determines at runtime which method to execute (from superclass or subclass).
